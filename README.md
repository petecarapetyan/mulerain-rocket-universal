# Universal Rocket

_rocket: dated December 2020_

What is Universal Rocket?

This particular rocket theme is for the boss or client that _**has to have**_ Rocket on his/her own terms.

It leaves out everything that your boss or client could conceivably find objectionable, and then lets you substitute his/her version of that back into the Rocket theme.

- other data structures or schema
- other page content types
- other nunjucks file configurations
- other mobile/@media configurations
- etc

Of course, you want to tell your boss or your client that they are missing the best of what Rocket has to offer, but at least this way, you _** still get the essential benefits that only Rocket offers:**_

- mdjs
- automated page navigation without requiring eleventy front-matter

## How it was created

These themes were copied from 

- _assets
- _data
- _includes

## Not for everyone!

Most Rocket consumers will prefer the fully-fleshed-out version. And for good reason!

This is for those unfortunate few that must start with incompatible themes and content structures imposed externally.

## Finishing up after installation

Dude! You just installed an almost themeless theme. Congratulations - _or something, eh? Maybe not?_

You still have all the hard work still left to do. Everything from handling the service worker to graphics to gosh knows what other front page and mobile fanciness that your heart desires.

You'll probably want to straight back to Rocket for inspiration and how-to examples. Now you've got the freedom to do it your way! Or, your boss's way, or your client's way.
